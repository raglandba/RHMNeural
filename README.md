# RHMNeural
My own ideas towards a novel neural network package in Java

### Features
  - Various Neuron Types such as Inhibitory, Modulatory, and Excitatory to mimick life
  - Ability to output raw activity snapshots
  - Ability to output waveform patterns ("brain waves")
  - Ability to output matrix patterns ("classical neural network")
  
 ### Status
  - Just began working on the idea and prototype
